1. Purpose
==========

The purpose of this script is to easily set and switch between several
sets of configuration options ("themes") for the i3 window manager.
These sets of configuration options are supposed to contain options
regarding the looks of the window manager, that is window colors,
borderstyle, i3bar colors, fonts, etc.
There's a bunch of theme files which are distributed together with
the j4-make-config script to give the user a variety of configurations to
choose from.

2. License

GNU General Public License v2:

The theme files are either ports of themes from other window managers,
assembled from i3 configurations found on the net or original themes
done by various peole. Oliver Kraitschy does not have any copyright for
themes ported from other window managers, found on the net or done by
other people.

3. Authorship and feedback, contributions etc.
==============================================

There is a git repository available at github:

https://github.com/okraits/j4-make-config

This software was initiated by Oliver Kraitschy (http://okraits.de).
Please feel free to send him feedback and contributions regarding
bugreports, feature requests, improvements, themes, etc. via mail at
okraits@arcor.de. You can also contact him on irc.twice-irc.de in #i3.

4. Installation
===============

Extract the tarball you downloaded with

tar -xzvf j4-make-config-X.X.tar.gz

where X.X is the version you downloaded.


The resulting directory contains a python script named j4-make-config. Place
it anywhere in your $PATH, for example in /home/<yourUserName>/bin, and
ensure that it is executable.


The resulting directory also contains a directory named themes. It
contains all themes distributed with j4-make-config. You must move it to the
directory where your i3 config file is.


As the next step, you should prepare your i3 configuration file for
j4-make-config. If you already have window color settings in your i3
configuration file, you should completely replace them with a marker
which gets replaced with the window configuration included in the chosen
theme file. We demonstrate this with the default color settings
(normally they are not explicitly set in the i3 configuration file):

Replace the default colors

# class                 border  backgr. text    indicator
client.focused          #4c7899 #285577 #ffffff #2e9ef4
client.focused_inactive #333333 #5f676a #ffffff #484e50
client.unfocused        #333333 #222222 #888888 #292d2e
client.urgent           #2f343a #900000 #ffffff #900000

with the following marker:

# $i3-theme-window

If you didn't configure custom window colors yet, you can simply add the
line "# $i3-theme-window" at the end of your i3 configuration file.


You can apply the same procedure to prepare your bar section for
j4-make-config. If we take the default bar colors for example (normally they
are not explicitly set in the i3 configuration file), your bar section
should look like this:

bar {
	status_command i3status
    colors {
        background #000000
        statusline #ffffff
        separator #666666

        focused_workspace  #4c7899 #285577 #ffffff
        active_workspace   #333333 #5f676a #ffffff
        inactive_workspace #333333 #222222 #888888
        urgent_workspace   #2f343a #900000 #ffffff
    }
}

Replace the whole colors section with the following marker:

# $i3-theme-bar

If you didn't configure custom bar colors yet, you can simply add the
line "# $i3-theme-bar" at the bottom of your bar section. Either way,
this marker will get replaced with the bar configuration included in the
chosen theme file.

As a last step, you should rename (move in the unix world) your config
file to config.base, as j4-make-config generates a config file out of
config.base and the theme file it gets as a commandline argument.

5. Usage
========

To create an i3 configuration which includes a certain theme, run:

j4-make-config <theme-name>

To create an i3 configuration without including a theme, run:

j4-make-config none

6. Changelog
============

v0.4 18-09-2013:

- use "# $i3-theme-window" and "# $i3-theme-bar" as markers, both in the
  theme files and in config.base
- "i3-theme none" generates a config file without including a theme
- i3-theme looks for the i3 configuration in $HOME/.i3,
  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/i3 and $HOME/.config/i3
- added debian and ubuntu themes (thanks lasers!)

v0.3 17-09-2013:

7. FAQ
======

This README and the script and themes aren't complete or perfect at all,
so please do not hesitate to contact me for questions, bugreports,
 feature requests, comments, improvements, etc. via:

Mail: okraits@arcor.de
IRC: #i3 on irc.twice-irc.de

8. Todo list
============

These are things which are planned to be done, at some point
in the future.

- rename i3-theme to j4-make-config in all files (themes etc.)
- make j4-make-config a more general config-generation tool:
  = have one general config file config.base
  = have several host-specific config files config.hostname
  = then issue j4-make-config -t <theme> -h <hostname>
- have more than 2 markers, that means: exchange each marker
  in the config.base file with the corresponding marker in
  the theme file (or in a host-specific config file)
- optional: j4-make-config starts i3 after it generated a
  temporary config file
- display usage info with j4-make-config --help
- running j4-make-config without arguments makes j4-make-config
  use the last used options - these must be stored in a rc file
- put every theme in a separate directory - this would help to
  = provide variations of themes
  = enable users to make modifications of themes
  = provide additional files like licences or README files
